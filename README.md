# Hi there :wave: I'm Milee.
I'm a product design leader building human-centered AI systems from the ground up. I've led multiple 0-to-1 AI products used by millions worldwide, and I also create the design systems and frameworks that help teams build AI that's trustworthy, accessible, and scalable. Colleagues often refer to this cross-team impact as the 'Milee multiplier effect.' I bridge strategy and execution, aligning product and engineering to move from early ideas to real, measurable impact.

Currently, I'm the founding designer on Coursera's GenAI incubation team, a small autonomous group building AI-native products.
